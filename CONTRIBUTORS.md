[MOBATSim project](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/ifa/at/forschung/research-projects) started as a closed project at the [Chair of Automation](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/ifa/at) at TU Dresden in September 2017; the first open-source version was published on GitHub under MIT license on July 21, 2020.
We acknowledge the contributions of all the students and supervisors.

The contributions that are merged to the project's main branch are summarized and listed below. As most project parts are done collaboratively, so this list may not be complete.
All the studies regarding the student theses, SA (Studienarbeit) and DA (Diplomarbeit), are conducted at the [Chair of Automation](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/ifa/at) at Technische Universität Dresden (TU Dresden).
