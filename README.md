# **MOBATSim**

MOBATSim (Model-based Autonomous Traffic Simulation Framework) is a simulation framework based on MATLAB Simulink that allows the user to assess vehicle level and traffic level safety by a 3D traffic simulation.

Overview
---
MOBATSim has a project file which includes the Simulink files and their paths. As you run `MOBATSim.prj`, a GUI will open and you can run simulations from that GUI. The live script is a more detailed documentation than this one.

```
uiopen('\MOBATSim.prj',1)
```

# **Requirements**

MATLAB version requirement
---
MOBATSim is continuously updated with different versions of MATLAB. Therefore, at this moment, the requirement is MATLAB 2020a.

Toolbox Requirements
---
* Simulink 3D Animation Toolbox™ (required for the 3D Animation Model)
* Model Predictive Control Toolbox™  (will be soon required)
* Simulink Coverage™ (will be required in the next versions for testing and code coverage analyses)
