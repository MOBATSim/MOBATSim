Issues:
Exception calling MATLAB: Derivative of state '1' in block 'MOBATSim/Vehicle Model 8/Longitudinal Speed Control/Vehicle Acceleration Model/Vehicle Acceleration Dynamics' 
at time 116.66 is not finite. There may be a singularity in the solution. 
If not, try reducing the step size (either by reducing the fixed step size 
or by tightening the error tolerances)
Possible solutions---
There are two reasons that might cause it. First thing to check is to make 
sure the system is stable with the implemented controller. Second is to check 
the solver step size is small enough for the solution of the ODE to be stable 
(this means just reduce the maximum step size for variable step ODE solvers 
or change to one of the fixed step size solvers and choose a small step size).
when it appears, then try:
(1) Try reducing fixed step size
(2) Go to model configuration parameters/Solver/Solver Options:
    Type: Variable-step
    Solver: ode15s (stiff/NDF)
